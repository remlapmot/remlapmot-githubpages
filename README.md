# GitHub Pages website source code

[![Website remlapmot.github.io](https://img.shields.io/website-up-down-green-red/https/remlapmot.github.io.svg)](https://remlapmot.github.io/)

This repo contains the source files for my GitHub Pages website made with the [blogdown package](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) in R.

To build the site, issue from this folder: `blogdown::build_site()`. This will create a directory called public which is my remlapmot.github.io repo on GitHub.
