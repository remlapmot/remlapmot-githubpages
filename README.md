# GitHub pages website source code

[![Website remlapmot.github.io](https://img.shields.io/website-up-down-green-red/https/remlapmot.github.io.svg)](https://remlapmot.github.io/)

This repo contains the source files for my github pages website made with the blogdown package in R.

To build the site, from this folder issue: `blogdown::build_site()`. This will create a directory called public which is my remlapmot.github.io repo on GitHub.
