I am a Lecturer in Medical Statistics at Lancaster University in the UK. My Lancaster University webpage is here: https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/people/tom-palmer.

This website is made using the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package in R and Hugo. To make some tweaks to the default styles I followed some of the advice by Andrew Bates here: https://asbates.rbind.io/2018/05/09/customize-blogdown-theme/
