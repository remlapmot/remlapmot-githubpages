I am a Senior Lecturer in Biostatistics applied to Genetics affiliated to the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit (MRC IEU) in Population Health Sciences in Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol in the UK. 

My University of Bristol webpage is [here](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/tom-m-palmer(bd750b43-03d6-4e2e-af74-c24eb2bf5c5a).html).

This website is made using the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package in R which uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). To make some tweaks to the default styles I followed some of the advice by Andrew Bates [here]( https://asbates.rbind.io/2018/05/09/customize-blogdown-theme/).
